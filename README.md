# UJK-CS-2018
I've created this repository because I crave approval from my peers. No, not really, but that's as good a reason as any so think what you will. I can't help that I love coding, whether it's for myself or others, so choosing to help people along the way is a no-brainer. Why would I even write this kind of description, you ask? I have no clue.
